# Favorite equation
The [divergence theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence_theorem), also referred to with any combination of
names *"Gauss"*, *"Green"*, and *"Ostrogradski"*.

$$
\int\limits_V \nabla \cdot \vec{F} \hspace{5pt} dV = \int\limits_{\partial V} \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{s}
$$

It's one of those equations where it *looks* like such a cryptic, arbitrary relation, but once you *get it* you know
that it must obviously be true. Like $1+1=2$ level of true. Arguably the [generalized Stokes
theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_Stokes_theorem) is prettier, but not as satisfying.

$$
\int\limits_\Omega d\omega = \int\limits_{\partial\Omega} \omega
$$

Show this to anyone and they will scratch their head wondering what does the $\int$ sign even mean without some sort of
$dx$ to go with it (hint: it's hidden in the $\omega$). Not nearly as intuitive.

Close second would be the [Born rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_rule) (Born postulate if you are a communist),
which is the very reason everyone saying: *"Physicists don't use Akham's Razor, just look at quantum mechanics!"* is
wrong and cannot be trusted.

$$
\mathbb{P}(\lambda_n) = \vert \langle n \vert \psi \rangle \vert^2 
$$

Just look at it. So pretty. And so intuitive.
