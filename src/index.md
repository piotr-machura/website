# About me 
**Question:** What do coffee filters, constant magnets and the Internet have in common?<br>
**Answer:** They all undergo type 2 percolation-like phase transition.

But only if you consider the Internet to be a Erdos-Renyi random network. Which doesn't really hold up (it's a
preferential attachment thing). Don't trust everything you read on someones' random website.

Hi, my name is Piotr Machura, and I study computer physics at Warsaw University of Technology, currently writing my
engineer's thesis on information diffusion in complex networks. In my free time I like to dissect works of fiction and over analyze every little detail, which is a horribly annoying
habit to have if you like watching TV shows with, say, your girlfriend.

I also write things in &#127477&#127473 **GLORIOUS POLISH** &#127477&#127473. Everything is listed below.
