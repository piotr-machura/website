# About me
> **Question:** What do coffee filters, constant magnets and the Internet have in common?

> **Answer:** They all undergo type 2 percolation-like phase transition.

That is, if you consider the Internet to be a Erdos-Renyi random network. Which *doesn't* really hold up (it's a
preferential attachment thing), but it *does* make for a nice opening line.

Hi, my name is Piotr Machura, and I study computer physics at Warsaw University of Technology, currently writing my
engineer's thesis on information diffusion in complex networks. You may not think that sounds like physics, and you
would be right. It's beautiful academic name is **interdisciplinary modeling**, which just rolls of the tongue so
easily along all those Hungarian names.

In my free time I like to dissect works of fiction and over analyze every little detail, which is a horribly annoying
habit to have if you like watching TV shows with, say, your girlfriend.

## Favorite equation
Of course it is the **[divergence theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence_theorem)**, also referred to with
any combination of names *"Gauss"*, *"Green"*, and *"Ostrogradski"*.
$$
\int\limits_V \nabla \cdot \vec{F} \hspace{5pt} dV = \int\limits_{\partial V} \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{s}
$$
It's one of those equations where it *looks* like such a cryptic, arbitrary relation, but once you *get it* you know
that i must obviously be true. Like $1+1=2$ level of true. Arguably the **[generalized Stokes
theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_Stokes_theorem)** is prettier, but not as satisfying.
$$
\int\limits_\Omega d\omega = \int\limits_{\partial\Omega} \omega
$$
Show this to anyone and they will scratch their head wondering what does the $\int$ sign even mean without some sort of
$dx$ to go with it (hint: it's hidden in the $\omega$). Not nearly as intuitive.

Close second would be the **[Born rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_rule)** (Born postulate if you are a
communist), which is the very reason everyone saying: *"Physicists don't use Akham's Razor, just look at quantum
mechanics!"* is wrong and cannot be trusted.
$$
\mathbb{P}(\lambda_i) = \langle \psi \rvert \hat{P_i} \lvert \psi \rangle
$$
Just look at it. So pretty. And so intuitive.

## Favorite software
**[Neovim](https://neovim.io/)** and **[Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/)** are tied for the first place. I just love
the feeling that no one else has the same environment as me. Literally no human on the entire planet, because I made parts
of it from scratch.

Dead last would be Microsoft Teams. Imagine a video chat client that consumes 50% more RAM idling than my entire operating
system (seriously, it's 600MB of Teams doing nothing vs 400MB of Linux doing nothing).

Also, I have added a paragraph to a README of an open source ZSH plugin, so I am *technically* and open-source
contributor. No need to thank me.

## Favorite fiction
Books are hard to choose from. Don't get me wrong, Stephen King is great, but once he goes over the ~150 page limit the
integrity of any King story starts rapidly going downhill. I still can't shake off the dreaded 20 page character
dilemmas about a massacre staged by *I know who*. I'm looking at you, *"Needful Things"*, with your pointless catholic
vs baptist battles (I skipped the whole chapter there) and unsatisfying endings (why would the main character kick the
devil's ass, am I right? Just let him ride away, he only made half the town murder each other).

**But**, when King keeps his stories short and concise, they can be incredible. *"Big Driver"* (and basically
anything else from *"Full dark no stars"*) just engraves itself in your brain, you know? You just can't stop reading.

Honorable mention goes to *"Silmarillion*" by Tolkien. I like the mythology style, but a narration without a main
character (and a ~700 page book with barely any dialog) can be just a tad bit boring at times. Or almost all the time,
if you have an attention span of a 6-year old.

Favorite show is *"Braking Bad"* (if judged as a whole), or *"The Boys"* if we are allowed to count the first couple of
episodes. The latter is edgy as hell and I *love it*. When I grow up I want to be just like Jimmy Butcher.

When it comes to movies I like *"Whiplash"* the most, the story is just so simple and the characters so concise. If we
are counting
ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±
**Polish**
ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±
movies then *"DzieÅ„ Å›wira"* somehow manages to be the funniest, most quotable and at the same time the most depressing
thing I have ever seen.

## Social media
Jokes on you, I have none. There is a link to my GitHub in the navigation bar and *that's it*. In fact, social media is on my
**"Things I can't wait for to die"** list, along with shopping malls and gasoline powered cars. But, unlike the other
two, social media is probably sticking around. Forever.
