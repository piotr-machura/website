**Question:** What do coffee filters, constant magnets and the Internet have in common?<br>
**Answer:** They all undergo type 2 percolation-like phase transition.

But only if you consider the Internet to be a Erdos-Renyi random network. Which doesn't really hold up (it's a
preferential attachment thing). Don't trust everything you read on someones' random website.

Hi, my name is Piotr Machura, and I study computer physics at Warsaw University of Technology, currently writing my
engineer's thesis on information diffusion in complex networks. In my free time I like to dissect works of fiction and over analyze every little detail, which is a horribly annoying
habit to have if you like watching TV shows with, say, your girlfriend.

I also [write](/writing) things in &#127477&#127473 **GLORIOUS POLISH** &#127477&#127473. Don't read it though, it's
*pure garbage*.

The things I write when I'm angry or excited. Some of them are related to my software projects, some are not. It's like
a box of chocolates - you never know what you're going to get.
